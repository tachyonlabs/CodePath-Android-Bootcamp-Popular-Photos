# Project 1 - Popular Photos

Popular Photos is an android app that allows a user to check out popular photos from Instagram. The app utilizes Instagram API to display images and basic image information to the user.

Time spent: I'll try to put a value in here for next week's assignment, because I know it's useful information for you to aggregate from the class as a whole, but right now I just don't want to feel like I'm in a race or something.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **scroll through current popular photos** from Instagram
* [x] For each photo displayed, user can see the following details:
  * [x] Graphic, Caption, Username
  * [x] Relative timestamp, like count, user profile image

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Display each user profile image using a RoundedImageViewDisplay each user profile image using a [RoundedImageView](https://github.com/vinc3m1/RoundedImageView)
* [x] Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading
* [x] Improved the user interface through styling and coloring

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [x] Show last 2 comments for each photo

## Notes

OK, this one --
* [x] Display each photo with the same style and proportions as the real Instagram
-- confuses me. On one hand, I **think** so, because all the photos displayed look like perfectly fine Instagram photos, but on the other hand I can't make Instagram display the exact same photos for comparison. With photos that display with whitespace on the sides and/or top and bottom of the photo, this does seem to be part of the image the person uploaded rather than that I am displaying it incorrectly. Also, I guess that Instagram photos used to all be square, but this is no longer the case: [Thinking Outside the Square: Support for Landscape and Portrait Formats on Instagram](http://blog.instagram.com/post/127722429412/150827-portrait-and-landscape)

Also, this -- 
* [x] Show latest comments for each photo
-- is listed as an "optional" feature, whereas this --
* [x] Show last 2 comments for each photo
-- is listed as a "bonus" feature, and I'm not really sure what the difference is.
